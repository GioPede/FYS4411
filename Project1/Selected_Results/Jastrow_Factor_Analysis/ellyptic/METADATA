These data represent the simulation on systems of 10, 50, 100 bosons with
interaction and without. The plot shous the ratio of the energies for each 
alpha. 
PARAMETERS:
alpha  -> from 0.15 to 0.7 in steps of 0.5
beta   =  2.82843
a      =  0.0043 for interaction
       =  0      for non interacting

MC CYCLES = 10^6
